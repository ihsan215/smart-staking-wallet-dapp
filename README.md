# Smart Staking Wallet - DApp

[Live Demo](https://smart-staking-wallet.web.app/)

# Description:

This repository contains the codebase for a staking wallet that empowers users to engage in staking activities with Ethereum (ETH) to earn, an ERC20 token. The wallet interface enables seamless deposit and withdrawal functionalities from a staking pool, providing users the flexibility to manage their staked assets effortlessly.

Here's a breakdown of our platform's functionalities and guidelines:

- An account can create as many wallet addresses as it wants.
- Deposits and withdrawal transactions can be made to the created wallet addresses.
- Any amount of staking transactions can be earned from each wallet address.
- Staking money accumulates as a AET token reward during the time it is held.
- When the unstake transaction is made, reward tokens are sent to the transaction wallet address.
